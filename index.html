The purpose of this fleet mining initiative is to provide novice players in efficiently mining and selling ore directly from the belt, ensuring nearly instantaneous payment.<br/><br/>
During the mining session, I will provide boosts and compression services. You'll have the choice to deposit your ore into my fleet hangar either at the session's end or whenever you're finished mining the ore.<br/><br/>
I'm offering a rate of <i>95% of the Jita Buy</i> price <b>ONLY</b> for the ore mined during the session.
